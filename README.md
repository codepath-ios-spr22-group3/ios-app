## Overview
### Description
A productivity app that allows users to create custom habits/tasks that they can check off if they have been completed that day/week/month or specific time period.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** This app is only supported on mobile (iOS) for now, but we may support other platforms in the future.
- **Story:** Allows users to create custom habits/tasks where they can view whether they have been following their set goals or not.
- **Market:** Any individual, regardless of age/gender/sexuality could choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as the time period of the habits/tasks the user sets as goals.
- **Scope:** First we would want our users to create custom habits/tasks with a specific time period on when they plan on completing those habits/tasks (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/etc). Then they should be checking off those habits/tasks when they are completed.
